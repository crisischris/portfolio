    <h1 id="paragraph" class="bold">about me</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">Hi, my name is Chris.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p id="paragraph">Truthfully, my first passion in life was architecture.
    I’ve spent the last several years working as an architect at the largest
    architectural firm in the world. During that time I discovered the power of
    storytelling using VR and AR which snowballed into learning and harnessing game
    engines and, eventually,  programming. I’m working towards parlaying my existing
    knowledge of architecture, space and human scale and my accumulating knowledge
    of programming into a more focused career within spacial computing and graphics.
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph">Currently, I work as an architect in Seattle.  Aside from
      being an architect, I am also the point person in the Seattle office for XR
      duties such as helping to integrate XR into our design workflow and to
      evangelize new and emerging tool sets / workflows. I see spacial computing
      as the future, and am very much all-in to help make that a reality.  Oh, I
      am also enrolled in Oregon State’s BS in Computer Science program - which
      leaves me quite busy.
